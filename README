An R Library for Manipulating Strings
================================================

This library currently defines a set of functions that let you convert strings into their title case form. The code is roughly based on Sam Souder's Ruby extension, titlecase, which you can find at,

	http://github.com/samsouder/titlecase/tree/master

Sam's code, in turn, was based on code by John Gruber, which you can find at,

	http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case
	
But any bugs can be attributed to my (mis)?interpretation of Sam and John's code.

Currently there's a non-functional test suite using RUnit that I'd like to get working. I'd welcome any suggestions. Similarly, I'd be glad to incorporate any and all features that would help to make this a true R string operations library, rather than just another one-off hack.
